# AWS lambda EC2 timer switch
Automatically stop and start Amazon EC2 instances using [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

The official way to schedule start and stop times for EC2 instances is using AWS Data Pipeline, as described [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/stop-start-ec2-instances/).
This is an alternative way using AWS Lambda.
